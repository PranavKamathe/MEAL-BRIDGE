# 🍽 Food Bridge — Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 Starting the Application

### Step 1: Start MongoDB
Make sure MongoDB is running on your machine:
- Open **MongoDB Compass** or run `mongod` in a terminal (MongoDB Community must be installed)

### Step 2: Start the Backend
```
cd backend
npm run dev
```
Server starts at: http://localhost:5000

### Step 3: Start the Frontend  
Open a second terminal:
```
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
App runs at: http://localhost:5173

## 👑 Create Admin Account (First Time Only)

Run this command in PowerShell after starting the backend:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:5002/api/admin/create" -Method POST -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{"name":"Admin","email":"admin@foodbridge.com","password":"Admin@123","secretKey":"FOODBRIDGE_ADMIN_2026"}'
```

Then login at http://localhost:5173/login with:
- **Email**: admin@foodbridge.com
- **Password**: Admin@123

## 🔐 How OTP Works (Development Mode)

Since no email service is configured, OTPs are printed to the **backend server terminal**.

When you login:
1. Enter email + password → Click Continue
2. Look at the backend terminal — you'll see:
   ```
   ========================================
   🔐 OTP for Your Name (email@example.com): 482917
   ⏰ Valid for 2 minutes
   ========================================
   ```
3. Enter that 6-digit OTP in the frontend
